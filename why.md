using this as an inspiration to do little programming problems to more rapidly implement algorithmic solutions.
being a firmware engineer is rewarding, but it has its downsides when it comes to fullfilling my inate desire to solve problems and write code.
rarely do i sit down to investigate a problem and have a working solution the same day. often i find myself debugging or even spending lots of time trying to figure out _how_ to debug in the first place.

this, to me, is a reinvigoration on my love for writing software.
